      My name is Austin, and I am a Software Engineer with experience
      architecting, developing, and managing enterprise applications. I
      specialize in web application development using Full-stack
      Javascript/Typescript (React & Node.js). I also have experience working
      with other tech stacks including Python, C#/.NET, and SQL. I am passionate
      about architecting and developing user-friendly, scalable, and secure
      systems.

      I am a no-nonsense problem solver, with a determination to find the best
      solution that is akin to a chef searching for the perfect dish. I am a
      master of my craft, with a depth of knowledge and experience in software
      engineering that is as deep and varied as a gourmet collection of unique
      and diverse ingredients, with an attention to detail that is as precise as
      a sushi knife. My unorthodox approach to coding often leads to
      breakthroughs, like a lightbulb moment in a dimly lit noodle shop.
